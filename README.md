# Ultimate Dashboard
Arduino powered vehicle dashboard

This is the first draft version.


Initially this will use three Arduino UNO's.


They are arranged as:

Speedometer
 - Displays speed in KPH or MPH
 - Has three digit led display (serial)
 - Intended to have 15 neopixel 1/4 array as well (this will depend on space in the dashboard but will be included in software)

Tachometer
 - Displays RPM
 - Has 4 digit led display (serial)
 - Has programmable Redline and Shift
 - Intended to have 15 neopixel 1/4 array as well (this will depend on space in the dashboard but will be included in software)

Gauges
 - Has Voltmeter, Oil Pressure Meter, Water Temperature Meter and Fuel Level Meter
 - Can be expanded to include other meters
 - Initially will be on 4 digit led displays (serial)
 - Possibly use oled graphic displays instead.
